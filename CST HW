Paragraph we have chosen:
But a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves.

Prepare a short, informal presentation for sharing with the class

Slide 1
Title: Just because we can intervene by collecting data, should we?
Exerpt: "The degree of human intervention often in the service of business interests and consumerism is making our earth...more limited"
Commentary:
Data analysis in consumerism and other business interests can restrict our abilities to see the world as something other than ones and zeroes
Consumerism is a social ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amountss

This begs the question, at what point do we stop trying to organize things into categories and just accept intricacy without trying to simplify it

Slide 2
Title: Is artificial intelligence undermining the beauty of the human mind?
Exerpt: "We seem to think we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves"
Commentary:
We discussd in class the introduction of robotics and computers like Watson into society may dilute the intricacies of the world and humanity: reduction of interpersonal skills, reduction of the human experience with specialized content, widening the gap between higher/lower resources families, unemployment, etc.
diagnosing better than doctors can
Is the human brain too intricate and irreplaceable for artificial intelligence, are we undermining the complexity of humans by trying to create machines that think like them?
Slide 3
Title: Conclusion
Commentary:
Instead of a conclusion slide we could have an introductory one talking about Laudato Si:
ENCYCLICAL LETTER LAUDATO SI' OF THE HOLY FATHER FRANCIS ON CARE FOR OUR COMMON HOME
Pope Francisâ€™ Encyclical Laudato Si is a worldwide wake up call to help humanity understand the destruction that man is rendering on the environment and mankind.
The encyclical implies a relationship of mutual responsibility between human beings and nature.  In general, we can take from the earth whatever we need, but it also our duty to protect the earth and to ensure it for future generations.
